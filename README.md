# Weatherapp

## Changes

We got this cool weatherapp project from Eficode that tells Helsinkis current weather with one icon. Pretty cool huh? But I decided to make things a littlebit more interesting. I modified the backend index.js file so that we got ALL Helsinkis weather data from api. In base project api returned only description, icon and couple other attributes. In my version we get all the cool stuff like windspeed, humidity, mist, ect. So I decided to pull some extra info from api and hide it to make things interesting. I coded this cool button below the icon that was in the base project. And by pressing that magical button my weatherapp 2.0 reveals some secrets about Helsinkis weather. By pressing the button app shows Windspeed, Temperature and the description of the weather instead of just the icon. Probably have to sell this one to Foreca.
